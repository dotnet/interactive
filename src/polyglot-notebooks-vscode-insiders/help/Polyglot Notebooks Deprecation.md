# 📢 DEPRECATION ANNOUNCEMENT: Polyglot Notebooks

The Polyglot Notebooks Extension will be deprecated on **March 27th, 2026**. 

## ❓What This Means

- The extension will not be disabled or uninstalled from your VS Code.
- No new features will be added.
- Bug fixes and support will end immediately.
- The extension will be marked as deprecated.

## ✅ Recommended Action

1. Convert/migrate your existing notebooks.
    - **If you were primarily working with C#:** Use our newly introduced [file-based apps!](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/sdk/file-based-apps) File-based apps let you build, run, and publish C# apps **_from a single C# file_** without creating a traditional project file. This makes file-based apps powerful for quick learning and experimenting just like Polyglot Notebooks! Follow your first tutorial [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/file-based-programs).
    - **If you were primarily working with other languages:** We recommend using the [VS Code Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) for your notebook needs. It supports a wide range of languages and offers robust features for notebook development. You can file requests for new features or report bugs in their [VS Code Jupyter GitHub Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter).
1. Uninstall the Polyglot Notebooks extension.
