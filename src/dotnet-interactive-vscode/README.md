# .NET Interactive Notebooks

This extension adds support for using the `dotnet-interactive` global tool from within VS Code in a notebook-like environment.

## Getting Started

1. Install the latest [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
1. Install this extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).
1. Launch VS Code Insiders like this: `code-insiders --enable-proposed-api ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode`
1. Open an existing file with the `.dotnet-interactive` extension.

## Development

Same steps as in [Getting Started](#Getting-Started).  Periodically the notebook APIs will change; the latest API can
be obtained by running the `.\update-proposed-api.ps1` script.
