    "# Variable Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    ".NET Interactive enables you to write code in multiple languages within a single notebook and in order to take advantage of those languages' different strengths, you might find it useful to share data between them. By default, .NET Interactive provides [subkernels](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/master/docs/kernels-overview.md) for three different languages within the same process. You can share variables between .NET subkernels using the `#!share` magic command."
